    <h2>Why do I need to install updates? </h2>
    <ul class="left">
        <li>You will be hosting your profile on your own POD. An index.html file will be written to the root directory of your POD (or a different folder if you prefer). This means can we can't update the application in the way that we would if we were hosting it</li>
        <li>When you click on the install button, your current index.html file will be copied to a folder called "backup", and the new index.html file will be created. </li>
        <li>Never grant an application access to your backup folder.</li>
        <li>You will have the option to rollback to a previous version, if, for whatever reason, you don't like the changes.</li>
    </ul>
