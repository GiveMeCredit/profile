    <p>Why do I need to install updates? </p>

    <p>You will be hosting your profile on your own POD. An index.html file will be written to the root directory of your POD (or a different folder if you prefer). This means can we can't update the application in the way that we would if we were hosting it.</p>
    <p>When you click on the install button, your current index.html file will be renamed to index-backup.html, and the new index.html file will be created.</p>
    <p>You will have the option to rollback to a previous version, if, for whatever reason, you didn't like the changes.</p>
